<a name="usage"></a>
## üñ• Usage 
This application allows you to navigate different link routes that display data from the database. I reccomend using Insomnia to run the Social Network API as seen in the demo above.

- GET/POST routes: <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/users` <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts`<br>

- PUT/DELETE routes: <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/users/:id`<br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:id` <br>

- POST/DELETE routes: <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/users/:id/friends/:friendId` <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:id/reactions` <br>

    - Please note you can GET, POST, PUT or DELETE a user, thought or reaction by adding its `/id` at the end of the link respective to field you would like to GET, POST, PUT or DELETE.
